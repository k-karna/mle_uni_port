#### Submitted for the application of ``machine learning developer``
Based on the two datasets i.e, Till Activity and Front End Efficiency <br>
<p>Task</p>
AI/ML approaches to cluster consumers based on the given data <br>
Propose any approach to collect consumer satisfaction data and use it to classify tasks and roles within each store<br>
Are there any other possible measures to evaluate clients with respect to efficiency, roles, and activities?

Please include the answer to the following test questions in your presentation:
Q1: For each client (or store):

    Q1.1: estimate (a) time spent, 
    (b) infectiveness time i.e. time with no value added  (NVA), 
    (c) pace (i.e. rate of task), and 
    (d) efficiency for each task
    Q1.2: estimate the activity time, i.e., how long does a process/activity take?
    Q1.3: estimate the time spent on each category 


Q2: As in Q1 but considering all the clients together

Q3: Propose some solutions to reduce NVA and improve the efficiency of clients
